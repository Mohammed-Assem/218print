## 218print

218print is a simple bedslinger 3d printer designed to be as cheap as possible. I wanted to do this project because I don't know about 3d printers and I hoped to have one, so it was like a challenge to build it. I used3d printed parts in the motion of z-axis to be cheaper than universal plates.
