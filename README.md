## 218print

  218print is a simple bedslinger 3d printer designed to be cheep as possible. I wanted to do this project because I don't know about the 3d printers alot and I hoped to have one so it was like a chalange to build it. I used openbuilds and grabcad helping me in my designs. I used a 3d printed parts in the mothion of z axis to be cheaper than universal plates.
